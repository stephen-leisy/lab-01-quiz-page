# lab-01-quiz-page

the Plan:

html:
there should be basic html outlining some sloth fact and maybe a pic or two with a cute sloth

there will be a button with an id tag
there will be a secret dev also with an id tag

js:
I will create DOM elements for the button and the secret dev 

I will create an event listener to start my quiz when the user clicks the button

i need to respond to user input in 'the cool zone' when i ask their name and 3 questions + I will count the number of correct answers

then I will display the user name and the number of answers they got correct on the screen below the quiz button.
